    <p2> Hello. My name is Ruxandra.</p2>
        <p2> My nickname is Gigi, so if that is funnier, lets go with that. </p2>
     <p2>   I am a really curious person. I like meeting new people and learning new things. </p2>
          <p2> MMD is a challenge for me, a well chosen one as I was always dreaming about being able to build my own website. </p2>
            <p2> During the 1st Semester I learned that is not that easy but its also really beautiful as you can always find a different way to everything you want to do.</p2>
            <p2> Please feel free to wonder through my portfolio and don't hesitate to contact me!</p2>
            <p2> Xo,Xo, Gigi!</p2>
