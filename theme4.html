            <h1> 1. Design sprint  </h1>
            <p2> On this assignment we had to create a XD prototype. The theme was to make an improved Fronter, keeping in mind the specific audience and the goal of the task. Our idea was to improve Fronter by adding live lectures and chat function , but also to keep some functionality that are inside Fronter.</p2>
