            <h2> Legendary Saul Bass </h2>

            <p> Saul Bass was born in the Bronx district of New York in 1920. His strong passion for drawing was evident from his early childhood. Bass studied at the Art Students League in New York and Brooklyn College under Gyorgy Kepes, a Hungarian graphic designer who had worked with László Moholy-Nagy in 1930s Berlin and fled with him to the US. Kepes introduced Bass to Moholy’s Bauhaus style and to Russian Constructivism. </p>


            <p> During his 40-year career Bass worked for some of Hollywood’s most prominent filmmakers, including Alfred Hitchcock, Otto Preminger, Billy Wilder, Stanley Kubrick and Martin Scorsese.</p>

            </div>

            <p> Among his most famous title sequences are the animated paper cut-out of a heroin addict’s arm for Preminger’s The Man with the Golden Arm, the credits racing up and down what eventually becomes a high-angle shot of a skyscraper in Hitchcock’s North by Northwest, and the disjointed text that races together and apart in Psycho.</p>

            <p> When Alfred Hitchcock saw Bass' work he immediately recognized his extraordinary talent for visual communication design. In fact, Bass was the creator of the stunning, riveting title sequence of Vertigo (1958) his first work for Hitchcock, in which he shot an extreme close-up of a woman’s face and then her eye before spinning it into a sinister spiral as a bloody red soaks the screen.

            <p> “My initial thoughts about what a title can do was to set mood and the prime underlying core of the film’s story, to express the story in some metaphorical way. I saw the title as a way of conditioning the audience, so that when the film actually began, viewers would already have an emotional resonance with it..” — Saul Bass
