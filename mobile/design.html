            <h2> Organic style - Saul Bass </h2>

            <p> While researching about Saul Bass work I've discovered that his style could be recongnized by some specific colours, typografy or copy style. </p>
            <h1> Colours </h1>

            <div class="designpic">

                <img src="images/large/Ruxandra_Sandru_Project_Design_Saul_Bass_interactive4.png" alt="Colours">

            </div>
            <p> In his posters Saul Bass uses around 2-3 colours, powerfull like red or blue. The colours are enhanced with black or white ccontour or shapes. He laso used yellow or orange for powerfull images. On his logos Saul Bass has a clean and neat style, using only one, max 2 colours. </p>

            <h2> Typography </h2>

            <p> Typography narrates the style or appearance of a movie through title sequences, movie posters, opening and ending credits. </p>

            <div class="designpic">

                <img src="images/small/hITCHCOK.gif" alt="Typography">

            </div>

            <p> Hitchcock is a font designed by Matt Terich inspired by Saul Bass posters. Its a tribute to the designers posters and it has become the most used font when it comes to Saul Bass.</p>

            <p> The font is not a faithful digitization of any particular title sequence or poster — in fact, type designer Nick Shinn notes that Bass didn’t do the actual lettering and veteran Robert Trogman adds that Dave Nagata did most of the drawings — but it does give a general sense of Bass’ rough, hand-cut style.

                <h2> Logo design and inspiration </h2>

                <p> Definition: a symbol or other small design adopted by an organization to identify its products, uniform, vehicles, etc.
                    On this assignment i decided to work on my website logo in a style different than Saul Bass.
                    He created logos but i found its logo style a bit to rough and minimal.</p>

                <div class="designpic">

                    <img src="images/medium/20180909_005928.jpg" alt="Logo">

                </div>
                <p> I focused on the letter of the site name and also the ideea behind of it.</p>
                <p> The website will be a “visual story teller” website.</p>
                <p>The name was inspired by the lenses of the camera that are able to catch the beauty that the photographer sees.</p>
                <p>I focused on the starting letters of the words, trying to create a clean not so romantic look even though it might be suitable as well. I thought about introducting the concept of the camera in the logo as well.</p>
